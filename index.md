## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1  
 Although it was one of the most uncomplicated codes, this is how we all started. Hello.cc was a simple concept, and for new coders, no matter how simple it is, we still need clarification. We learned the most basic code and figured out how to have the terminal print out text. I liked this lab as I got to meet someone from the class and work with them. 

* Lab 3 
  I liked this lab, especially since it felt like the first one where we used more complex instructions to make a more significant project. We learned how to make programs run equations to find people's metabolisms and date differences. Both parts of it felt enjoyable to work with, and even though we asked our teacher's assistant many questions, it felt good to get the project done. 

* Lab 8 
  Lab 8 was a bit different; we had code for a program and a graphic visual part two. We used code and loops to create a visual pattern in the terminal and used math to find the average scores. It was difficult, but, in the end, it was a small and shortcode that made such a complex design.

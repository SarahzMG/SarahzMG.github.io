## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1  
  Although it was one of the simplest codes ever, this is how we all got started. Hello.cc was a simple concept and to new coders no matter how simple we still tend to get confused. I liked this lab as I got to meet someone from the class and work with them. 

* Lab 3 
  I liked this lab especially since it felt like the first lab where we are using more complect instructions to make a bigger project. Both parts of it felt interesting to work with, even though we asked many questions to our teacher's assistant it felt good to get the project done. 

* Lab 8 
  I found lab 8 to be a bit different, we had code for a program but along with that we had a graphic visual part two. We had to use code and loops to create a visual pattern in the terminal. I found it a bit difficult but, in the end, it was a small and short code that made such a complect design.
